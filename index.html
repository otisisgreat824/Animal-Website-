    <h3>facts about three animals that you may not know about  </h3>
    <mark>1.Mountain Gorilla</mark>
    <br>
    <br>
    <mark>Mountain Gorillas have been considered endangered by the IUCN's Red List since 2018. there are only about 1063 Mountain Gorillla's in the wild according to WWF. Mountain Gorilla's live in two isolated groups one in east-central Africa in just two isolated groups and one in the virginia Volcanoes (which spans from 3 different national parks in Uganda, Rwanda which is in the Democratic of Republic of Congo. Mountain Gorilla's are typically found in high altitude Montane and bamboo forests, which are surrounded by agriculture and settlements. you probably didn't know this but Mountain Gorialla's share 98% of DNA with humans now you may wonder why don't the Gorillas have the same attributes as humans well that's because they just haven't developed the necessary immunities. Mountain Gorilla's are one of the biggest, most powerful living primates. an average silverback gorilla can weigh up to 180 kilograms (that is almost equivalent to 30 stones) it also measures up to 170 centimeters which is over (5'5") tall on it's fours. while the female Gorilla's weigh around 90 kilograms and they measure up to 150 centimeters which is around (4'9").  Mountain Gorilla's spent around a quarter of the day eating around 85% of their diet is plant based. Mountain Gorilla's sleep in nests on the ground at night or in tree's made from foilages.The Gorilla's have over 16 calls. they live in family groups. in the wild gorilla's can live up to 40 years. as of right now the Mountains Gorilla's are still critically endangered although the population has slowly risen.</mark>

    <mark>2.Slow Loris</mark>
    <br>
    <br>
    <mark>the Slow loris is one of the rarest primates. their closest relative is the African bushbabies. although slow lorises are slow they can travel around 8 kilometers in one night. Lorises movement are almost snakelike and the reason why is because that the Loris has more spinal vertabrae than other primates. The second finger on a Slow Loris is used for gripping purposes. In some parts of Asia, the Loris is known to cure over 100 diseases. Compared to it's other nocturnal peers the Slow Loris has one of the slowest rates of development. Slow Lorises live in tropical rainforests of southeast Asia. Slow Lorises have two tougues one is used to clean their teeth and the longer one is used to slurp nectar from flowers. Slow Lorises are excellent at climbing they have incredibly strong hands and feet when the Lorises are hunting insects they will grip onto a tree and lunge forward to kill it's prey between both hands. Since Slow Lorises are Nocturnal they sleep during the morning and hunt during the night.</mark>
